------------------- THE GAME -------------------------------
Dokapon 3-2-1 is the second Dokapon game for the Super Famicom.
Like its predecessor, it follows a group of ragtag RPG heroes
across a board game-like map as they attempt to outmaneuver
each other and be the first to save the kingdom.
Characters move around with dice rolls (spinners) and can acquire
items and treasure depending on where they land.
They can also get into fights with random monsters to gain
experience points and level up, though being defeated
will cause them to lose a turn.

A remake for the Wii and PS2 was released in 2008.
