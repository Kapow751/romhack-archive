1.About Clock Tower
-------------------
Clock Tower is a horror/adventure title. I won't say much more than
that, 'cuz otherwise it'd be spoiler central :)

---------------
2.Patch History
---------------
The Clock Tower project started in May of 1999 and sat on its ass for
quite a long time when I realized I couldn't do anything with it :P
Tsama joined the project in May 2001 as a hacker and translator, and
Disnesquick joined in either June or July (probably July) as an ASM
hacker. Clock Tower also stands out being the only project so far that
I've not had -one- undocumented patch-related bug surface during beta
testing :D

September 10, 2001 - Version 1.01 Release
Fixes:
 -Missing space between two words in the introduction
 -The opening menu
 -Some wording when examining a calendar

September 8, 2001 - Initial version 1.00 Release

4.Known Issues
--------------
-Clock Tower will fail to run correctly in almost any emulator. There
are tons of emulation-related issues (blackscreening and graphic garble
being the two main culprits) which I am not responsible for. I have
heard that it's going to be fully supported in the next release of
ZSNES; as of this writing, the current version of ZSNES is v1.31B.

--------------------------
5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "clocktow.smc" make sure the patch
is "clocktow.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM HAS
a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 3.00MB (3,146,240 bytes), 3,149,824 bytes bytes used".

6. How to Play
--------------

Controls
--------
Clock Tower - The First Fear does not support the SNES mouse. Sorry.

Control Pad: Move cursor.
A Button: Hold and use the control pad to cycle through your inventory.
B Button: Panic Button. Hit it as fast as you can when Jen's portrait flashes!
X Button: Stops Jennifer.
Y Button: Press on Jen's left to have her walk left, on her right to have her walk right.
Double-tap to run.
When the cursor morphs into a box, use press to have Jen examine/manipulate its target.
L Button: Have Jen run left.
R Button: Have Jen run right.
Select Button: Unused, to my knowledge.
Start Button: Pause the game.

Game Modes
----------

There are three main modes in Clock Tower: "Normal" Mode, "Chase" Mode, and "Panic" Mode.

In Normal Mode, the objective is to locate your three friends and escape from the mansion.

During Chase Mode, your objective is to flee from whatever might be chasing you. All of the
"safe spots" are listed in Appendix D, but it's a lot more thrilling to find them yourself.
You'll know if you're in Chase Mode, because (with two or three exceptions) it's the only
time that music will be playing.

During Panic Mode, Jennifer's portrait will be flashing. Hit the B button as fast as you
can to survive Panic Mode.

A note about Jennifer's health:
Your health is shown by the color of Jennifer's portrait. When it's blue, you're in very
good (or perfect) health. When it's yellow, you're in good health. When it's orange, you're
in bad health, and when it's red you're in very bad/near death status. RUNNING WILL DEPLETE
JENNIFER'S HEALTH! To recover your heatlh, you can sometimes take a drink from the shelf in
the kitchen, or you can simply hit the X button a few times and wait. Jennifer will sit down
and her health will slowly recharge. You only need to be in orange health or better in very
few parts of the game (these will be marked) so feel free to run anyway. Health is very
unimportant in this game :)
