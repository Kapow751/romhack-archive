 2. Introduction/History
______________________________________________________________________

 Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R for the Super Famicon was made by
 Bandai and released for Japan in 1993.  It's a side-scroller type of
 game that also includes a street fighter style battle mode.  It takes
 place during season 2 of the Sailor Moon anime, where you have to
 fight through the villains of the Black Moon family.

 This is the second Sailor Moon game for SNES to be translated into
 english.  The project was initially started by Masamune in the latter
 half of 2001.  However, the ROM's graphics were all compressed and 
 required an ASM hacker to take a look at it.  So eventually Gaspar
 approached FuSoYa for help, and he agreed to do all the ROM hacking
 for the game.

 The text was extracted and sent off to Illusion, who translated
 most of it by the end of December.  But he encountered some computer
 problems, and the project was stalled for about a month.  Near the
 end of January, FuSoYa ran into silversonic, who offered to do the
 last of the text translation.  

 By early February of 2002, the text was done and the game went
 through some testing.  It was then released on March, 6 2002
 (Michiru's birthday).

 3. A small note from FuSoYa regarding the patch
______________________________________________________________________

 This patch is intended for use on a non-interleaved ROM with the 
 usual 0x200 byte header.  Annoyingly, the more commonly available
 trained version of the ROM fits these requirements, while the one
 good checksum ROM I found does not.  Therefore, this patch has been
 made so it will also completely remove the trainer if it exists, just
 in case you can't locate (or don't know how to convert to) the ROM
 this patch was created for.
