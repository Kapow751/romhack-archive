1.About Gunman's Proof
----------------------
Gunman's Proof is a nifty little adventure/Zelda-clone
game for the SNES. It places a heavier emphasis on action
than on puzzle solving, but there's still enough of an
element of exploration and stuff that it can easily be
considered in the same genre. If you're expecting another
Zelda game, though, complete with nifty puzzles and lots
of items, Gunman's Proof will probably let you down. It's
still quite a good game, though!

2.Patch History
---------------
I have no idea when this project started, as I was not
the one who originally started it. Sheex did so, quite
a while ago. I picked it up a month or two ago, whipped
up an 8x16 font, inserted the script, did all the other
funky stuff, and waited for Shih Tzu to do a bunch of
textual improvements on the script. The final product
is as you see it, and I'm quite satisfied with how it
turned out!

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "gunproof.smc" make sure the patch
is "gunproof.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES HAVE
a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "3.00 MB (3,146,240 bytes)". SNESTool can add any headers
for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.
Please note that the questions it prompts you for apply to copier-users
only; if you are playing the game in an emulator, your answers do not
matter. All that matters is that the header is -there-. SNESTool will
tell you "Header add to file(s) done." and you'll be all set.
