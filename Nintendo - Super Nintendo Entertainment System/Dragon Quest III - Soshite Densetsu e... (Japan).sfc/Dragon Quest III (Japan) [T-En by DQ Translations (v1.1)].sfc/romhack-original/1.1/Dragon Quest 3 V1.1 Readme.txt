	Dragon Quest 3 was originally released for the Famicom gaming system. The game included
drastic improvements over the first two games of the series. When Nintendo released it's 
new Super Famicom system which supported much better graphics, Enix couldn't help but
port the classic game to it. The game was also released on the Gameboy Color. However,
the Super Famicom version stands to be the most loved and cherished version of the
game to date. 

Some features of the game include.
- 4 party member system
- Party member classes and creation system
- Pachisi tracks as a side game
- Multiple continents to exlpore
- Fluid monster battle animations

Although the game should be playable from start to finish there are still some things
that need to be worked out. They include:

- Spell menu in stats can't fit full spell names... no space
- Occasional text overflow

	Pick your favorite IPS patcher and patch an UNHEADERED ROM!!!
To remove the header, you can use SnesTool or simply load the rom in Snes9x. 
Snes9x will ask if you want to remove it upon loading. Click yes. Then apply the IPS. 
DON'T USE SOFT PATCHING!!! IT WON'T WORK!
If you have trouble, ask someone else because I'm too busy.
