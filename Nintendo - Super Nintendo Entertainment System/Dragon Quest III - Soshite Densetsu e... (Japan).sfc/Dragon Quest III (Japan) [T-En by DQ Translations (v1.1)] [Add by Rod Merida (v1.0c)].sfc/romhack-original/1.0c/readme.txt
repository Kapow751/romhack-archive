DRAGON QUEST III (SNES) translation patch to English with ALL THE BUGS that messed female dealers' descriptions, corrupted saved games and froze the game, or made items in the Bag be disappeared (making the game partially & randomly unplayable) FIXED, besides others (see below).
v.1.0c

Bug fixes made by
(c) Rod Mérida, 25-XII-2021

Based on the DQTranslations' translation patch from Japanese to English, v.1.1,
(c) 2009 DQTranslations

	More information in: http://crackowia.com

It must be applied on an unpatched unheadered "Dragon Quest III (Japan)" ROM.
Patching over an English-patched headerless ROM (with the translation made by DQTranslations, v.1.1 with CRC32 checksum 07B89251) may also be possible.


The aforementioned bugs include...
  - The issue that made saved games be corrupted and deleted has been removed.
  - The issue that made some items in the Bag disappear after sorting them, has been fixed.
  - Every messed item description said by female dealers has been matched, reordered and corrected. Now female dealers' descriptions are playable.
  - Two paragraphs of the ending sequence narration, that were not shown at all in DQTranslations' English patch, even though they exist inside the ROM, have been restored by merging them with the other two pre-existing paragraphs that are shown.
  - Fixed the female dealer's description about the Mirror of Ra that either froze the game or glitched it.
  - Some questions in the personality test and the Crown's Jewel scenario were semantically reversed in DQTranslations' patch. This way, when you answered "Yes" the game was interpreting and accounting it like a negative answer, and vice versa. This patch slightly rephrases these questions, by respecting as much as possible their previous form and structure, so whatever you answer the game accounts what is expected to.
  - Giaga's Pit and Gaia's Navel are two different places; they were misnamed and confused in DQTranslations' patch as one only place: Gaia's Navel. This patch corrects that. Now these two places are differenced and correctly refered, as Giaga's Pit and Gaia's Navel, when it corresponds.
  - Some mentions of who may equip which in female dealers' descriptions overflew the window and garbled part of its text.
  - Added some missing apostrophes for saxon genitives, in female dealers' descriptions.
  - In the Plush Suit description, made by a female dealer, "It's a cute and huge helmet" has been replaced by "It's got a cute and huge helmet", since that suit doesn't belong to the category of helmets, but armours. However, when equipped it switches the character's sprite to someone dressed like a bipedal cat; so this dialog is actually intending that a cute and huge mask is included as part of that suit, and will change your appearance while wearing it.
  - Two personality names were the same in DQTranslations' patch: "Defiant". After having researched by comparing the list of personality names with the ones used in other translations, we have replaced the first "Defiant" by "Cynical", and left the second "Defiant" unchanged.
  - The item description of the "Mohawk Wig" provided by female dealers said that the wearer will seem "skilled" with it. After equipping it on different characters and noticing every of them temporarily change their personality to "silly", I've determined such a statement was to be corrected, by replacing "skilled" by "silly" (we had already done this while making the Spanish translation of this ROM, too, by translating this "skilled" by "un payaso" [a clown]; actually most of these bugfixes had already been included in such a Spanish translation patch of our own, which can also be acquired on our web: crackowia.com/dquest3s.html ).
