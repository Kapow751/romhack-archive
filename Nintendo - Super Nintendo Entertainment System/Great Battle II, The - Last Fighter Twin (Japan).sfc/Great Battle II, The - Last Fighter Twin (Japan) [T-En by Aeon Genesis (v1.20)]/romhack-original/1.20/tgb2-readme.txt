1.About Last Fighter Twin
-------------------------
A few days before Christmas I got it into my head that it would be a
fun idea to do translations for all five main-line The Great Battle
games, and release them all at once. I figured that, being action games,
they were all fairly small and the work would go pretty quickly. It did,
I guess, but it was also more stressful trying to get all these together
than I thought it was going to be. These were done to help provide a
little bit of context for anyone playing SRW OG: The Moon Dwellers in
English and who might have been looking for some history and context
for Fighter Roar, Compatible Kaiser, Dark Brain, and all the other
villains from that particular branch of Banpresto's history.

Last Fighter Twin is a 2D beatemup, along the lines of Final Fight or
Streets of Rage. There are a few points where, depending on the player's
performance during boss fights, the path splits and takes you down
alternate routes. It's reasonably decent and fairly fun.

6.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
1.00 MB (8mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header. (*exactly* 1,048,576 bytes)
No header. Patch will expand the rom to 1.50 MB.

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "tgb2.smc" make sure the patch
is "tgb2.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT
HAVE A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "1.00MB (1,048,576 bytes)". TUSH will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
have a header.
