What Needs To Be Done
=====================

Main character's name might glitch sometimes in the Status Window menu.

Uncertain if everything is translated.

One scrolling dialogue screen will display two complete translations.  We will 
alter this when we playtest that part of the game.

We are still playing through the game to fix contextual errors in the
script.  Expect a follow-up patch once this is complete.

How To Use This Patch
=====================

The IPS file must be patched to the original ROM image in order to play
this translation. If you are using ZSNES to play this game, then you
can simply place the IPS file in the same directory as your save files,
and ZSNES will automatically read the patch and apply it, without
changing your original ROM. The IPS file must be named the same as your
ROM for this to work.

If you are using another emulator, you will have to patch the game
manually. IPS.exe and Snestool are two common programs that can do
this, and they can be found at most emulation and translation websites.
Before patching your ROM, *always* make sure you keep a backup copy.

To use IPS.exe, type this at a command prompt:

IPS <ROM name> <IPS name>

where <ROM name> is the name and location of the ROM to be patched, and
<IPS name> is the name and location of the IPS file to be used.

Snestool has a graphic interface and doesn't require command line
arguments. After loading it, select the "Use IPS" option. Then find the
IPS file in the browser window to the left and select it. After that,
select the ROM that the IPS should be applied to.

The unpatched file size should be 3146240 bytes. The patched file size 
should be 3441152 bytes.  Any variation in the patched file size would be down 
to your patching utility and not the IPS file; it would also cause 
problems with running the ROM image.

There are two versions available of the Front Mission ROM image, version 1.0
and version 1.1.  Ver1.1 has a lot of internal changes, though nothing which
makes the gameplay any different.  It does, however, make the Front Mission 
translation patch incompatable with it.
If the translation patch is applied to a ver1.1 image, the game will inform
you upon startup that it has been patched to the incorrect version and will
progress no further.



================
Running the Game
================

The best medium would be a real 60Hz S-NES (via back-up unit) displayed
via a RGB SCART cable.

At the moment, the latest version of ZSNES doesn't display the overhead
island map correctly.
