   [RM01] Preface
   
  mziab

The purpose of this patch is to fix all known technical issues and translation mistakes in the
English translation released in 2001 by Frank Hughes et al. In essence, it's a backport of the
technical and textual fixes from my Polish translation made several years back. There is one new
thing I made especially for this patch, though - the rewritten narration screens. While they were
already (sort of) in English in the original Japanese game, their grammar left a bit to be desired
and the naming conventions were also slightly off, so I wrote compression tools and rewrote the text
a fair bit, taking modern spellings into account. Anyway, this is not a complete retranslation of
the game by any means, but I hope it helps Front Mission fans enjoy the game just a bit more. Enjoy!
