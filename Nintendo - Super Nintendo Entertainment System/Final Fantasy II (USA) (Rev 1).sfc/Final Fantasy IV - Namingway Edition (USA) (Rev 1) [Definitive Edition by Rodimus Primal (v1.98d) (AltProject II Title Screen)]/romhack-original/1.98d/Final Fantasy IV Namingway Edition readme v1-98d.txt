Final Fantasy IV - Namingway Edition v1.98d
By Rodimus Primal

The original purpose of this hack is to bring the names of things within Project II closer
to Square Enix's current naming of spells, items, monsters, and the like. Because of space
limitations, some things are abbreviated. In addition, all enemies have had their stats 
reverted to their more powerful Japanese Final Fantasy IV counterparts, and the final boss 
has his original battle script. Also, Rosa and Rydia have their original spell acquisition 
rates. B Button Dash is also added, but you must hold B before you move in order for it to work
if you are on the world map. It works as intended in towns and dungeons. Also, holding B while
in an airship will slow you down to help landing in tough spots (like Troia). While in battle, 
pressing X will skip a characters turn, and pressing Select will switch between Max HP and
ATB percentage. 

In addition to renaming, many parts of the script were rewritten to better match the original
Japanese and modern translations. Thanks

Instructions

Use a Final Fantasy II (US) (1.1).smc ROM without a header. Use a patching program to apply
one of the .ips patches included. I recommend using Lunar IPS to patch your ROM, but I 
cannot tell you where to get a ROM. If there are any patching issues, use the program,
tush, to ensure that you have an unheadered ROM. 

There are 3 patches included. You only need to apply one of them to your ROM, so there
is no need to stack any patches. 

-Final Fantasy IV Namingway Edition.ips 
	The full game with the updated title screen. This already has the add-on applied 
	so that you have as close as to the original Japanese title screen as we could. 
	Big thanks to chillyfeez for his hard work inserting this.
-Final Fantasy IV Namingway Edition (Project II Title Screen).ips 
	The full game with the title screen made by Paladin for the original Project II.
	This is for those who like the US title screen but wanted it to be properly 
	numbered as IV instead of II.
-Final Fantasy IV Namingway Edition Title Screen (add-on).ips
	This is the add-on patch created by chillyfeez. This is included so that those
	that want to apply it to other projects (such as Project II), or to a vanilla
	Final Fantasy II US.
