Final Fantasy IV Namingway Edition Changes guide
---------------------------------------------------

This document serves to list many of the changes made from the original
Final Fantasy II, to Project II, and then to Namingway Edition. First,
it should be noted that the US Final Fantasy II alters the original
Japanese Final Fantasy IV in MANY ways. See the websites Legends of
Localization and tcrf.net to see them listed. 

Project II was FlamePurge's love letter to the US game, trying to clean up 
the poor grammar in the script, restore missing content, uncensor the
games graphics, and even give the US title screen it's proper numeral
of IV instead of II. 

Namingway Edition attempts to take this much further by bringing even
more removed content back in, and renaming everything as close as 
possible to current Square names. Sometimes abbreviations were used
and sometimes using extra text space, a lot of time and energy was 
spent on making this possible. Also, many of the balance changes made
in Project II were reverted back in Namingway Edition. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a list of changes made from Final Fantasy II US to FlamePurge's Project II:

- Features an entirely rewritten script, taking elements from various translations 
  of Final Fantasy IV.

- Restores almost all the missing content; you can use Pray, Salve, and Recall, 
  find SomaDrops and Firebombs in chests, and learn Armor and Shell! Shops have 
  also had their inventories and prices restored to normal, and enemies drop 
  their original items.

- Applies the Protect and Shell Improvement patch by Deathlike2, which makes Armor 
  and Shell more potent. (Credit to Deathlike2)

- Applies the Sing Improvement patch by Deathlike2, which adds a paralyzing song, 
  and replaces the muting song with a stopping song. (Credit to Deathlike2)

- Applies the Goblin Summon Enhancement patch by Deathlike2, which makes Imp’s 
  spell power based off Rydia’s Attack stat. (Credit to Deathlike2)

- Applies the Magic Plus patch by Deathlike2, which makes Sight a blinding spell in 
  battle and changes Dispel into a cursing magic. (Credit to Deathlike2)

- Applies the Bit Improvement patch by Deathlike2, which lets the Power Staff cast 
  Bersk, the Flame Whip cast Fire3, and the Wooden Mallet cast Lit-2. 
  (Credit to Deathlike2)

- Applies the Long Range Fix patch by Dragoon ZERO, which fixes the bug that allows 
  your characters to keep a long range weapon’s long range status if they switch to 
  a normal range weapon. (Credit to Dragoon ZERO)

- Applies the Warp Animation Enabling Patch by Dragonsbrethren, which allows Warp 
  to be cast in battle as an instant death spell. (Credit to Dragonsbrethren)

- Applies the Medicine Power-up Patch by Phoenix Hacks, which makes Heal restore 
  64-96 HP per person instead of 2-20. (Credit to Phoenix Hacks)

- Applies the Regen Power-up Patch by Phoenix Hacks, which has Regen heal 255 HP 
  per turn instead of 10. However, this has been lowered to 160 HP per round in 
  the interest of balance.  (Credit to Phoenix Hacks)

- Applies Final Fantasy IV: User Options by chillyfeez for extra controls—turn 
  skipping, sprinting, Active and Wait ATB modes, and an ATB gauge you can toggle. 
  (Credit to chillyfeez)

- Pray now has a 70% chance of working, and it casts Cure2 upon success.

- Cry now lowers all enemies’ Magic Defense by half of Porom’s Will per use.

- All bows’ receive +10 to Hit %, the Artemis Bow deals 4x damage to dragon-type 
  enemies, and the Heroine Robe now only gives +10 to Strength, Agility, and Vitality, 
  but the -15 penalty to Wisdom and Will are gone now. (Taken from FFIV: Easy Type)

- There is a new title screen by Paladin, which reads “FINAL FANTASY IV” in the style 
  of the FFII title logo. (Credit to Paladin)

- Reverts censored map graphics.

- Restores the stripping dancer in Baron Town.

- Fixes the Sealed Cave skip bug, the Adamant Armor bugs, the summoned monster items’ 
  descriptions, the “To equip” message, the message that appears when you try to leave 
  key items dropped by enemies, the RHand and LHand labels’ inconsistent appearance in 
  the battle item menu, the Black Robe’s incorrect stat bonus, and graphical errors. 
  (Credit to Grimoire LD for the Adamant Armor bug fixes, credit to Phoenix for the 
  “To equip” message fix, and credit to Dragonsbrethren for the summoned monster items’ 
   bug fixes)

- Sirens and Cure3 Potions can be bought from a shop at the end of the game.

- You can acquire the Assassin Dagger and HandAxe, formerly dummied weapons not even 
  used in the original Final Fantasy IV.

- Bonus supplementary lists to help you in your Final Fantasy IV quest. They are not 
  needed to play the game at all, but may be of assistance to blind players.

- Critical Hit Bug Fix added.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a list of changes made from Project II to Namingway Edition:

- An optional version of the title screen that is much like the original
  Japanese version in addition to the one used from Project II.

- L Button toggle for sprinting has been changed to a Press B to dash.
  You must be standing still, then Press and hold B, then move to dash.

- All maps have been restored including graphics for treasure chests, save
  points, and hallway overhangs. 

- The original Training Room that was changed in the US Final Fantasy II
  has been restored to the original smaller room. Also, its one and ONLY
  place find it (Baron's Devil Road) has been restored as well. 

- The Developer's Room that was removed to make room for the large Training
  Room has been restored.

- Monsters and bosses have been restored to their original difficulty. This
  includes Scarmiglione (originally Milon), Asura, and the Final Boss. 

- Character learning rates and stats returned to normal. 

- Class names were expanded to allow for longer names.

- Item descriptions have been expanded.

- Numerous changes made to the script to better match the original Japanese
  and modern translations.



Here's a list of most names that have been changed, except for dialogue differences.
