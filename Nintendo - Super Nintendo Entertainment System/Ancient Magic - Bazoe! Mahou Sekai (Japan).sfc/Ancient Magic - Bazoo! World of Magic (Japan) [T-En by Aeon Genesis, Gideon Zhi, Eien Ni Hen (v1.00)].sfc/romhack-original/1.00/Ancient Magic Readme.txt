1.About Ancient Magic
---------------------
Ancient Magic is a fairly generic little RPG for the SNES by the much-
maligned Hot-B. See if you can spot their advert for another of their
products in the game! Despite its rather pedestrian roots, the game
takes several surprising twists towards the end, and is generally worth
sticking it out even if the wrap-up (or lack thereof) is a bit of a let
down. As a note, there's more game past "THE END." Also as a note, do
set your window speed to "fast" in the in-game options menus - it'll
improve your experience dramatically.

2.Patch History
---------------
Working with this game was at times like pulling teeth, and at others
a blessed breeze. But I'm sick of looking at it right now; it's 1:00
in the morning, I have to be at work in eight hours, and I haven't
gotten a good night's sleep in several days. You'll excuse me for
keeping this brief.

4.Known Issues
--------------
--Blank digits in characters' Int statistic in the main Status window
display as part of the window border. Unsure why, at this time. This
issue is purely cosmetic and should not adversely alter your game
experience.

Please report any bugs, spelling errors, and such
on The Pantheon (http://agtp.romhack.net/pantheon)
Screenshots are preferred, as are savestates. SRAMs too if you can
create an Interrupt save in battle!

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
1.50MB (12mbit LoROM), WITHOUT Header (*exactly* 1,572,864 bytes)

Patch WILL expand the ROM to 2.00 megabytes (16mbit.)

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "amagic.smc" make sure the patch
is "amagic.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 1.50 MB (1,572,864 bytes)".
