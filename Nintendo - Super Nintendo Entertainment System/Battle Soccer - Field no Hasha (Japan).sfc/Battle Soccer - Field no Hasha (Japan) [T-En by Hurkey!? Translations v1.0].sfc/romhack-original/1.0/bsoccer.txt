Version 1.0
	-Initial Release

Hey there.  Hope you guys enjoy it.. it's a fairly entertaining SNES game.  
Your players can gain levels and you can recruit players from teams that
you beat, which makes it interesting.  This is one of those games that 
could have been better, but it's still pretty fun.  Anyway, let me know 
of any bugs so I can fix them. 

Thanks to the groups that translate the games that people actually give 
a damn about! (DeJap, Aeon Genesis, RPGe, and all of you other translation 
groups/individuals and emu authors out there.)

The splash screens that tell the player what "world" they're in are still 
in Japanese.. for the life of me I couldn't find a way to edit it to look 
good.  Oh yeah, and currently zsnes has some graphic issues near either 
goal.  This isn't a problem with the translation, and hopefully it'll be 
fixed in future versions.

                      | How to patch the game |
                      |-----------------------|

First, you need to get a good dump of Battle Soccer.  The easiest way would 
be to check the rom with goodsnes (available at www.zophar.net) and make 
sure that it is recognized as "Battle Soccer - Field no Hasya (J)."  Then 
simply open SnesTool (again, available at www.zophar.net) and use the ips 
on the unzipped rom.

Alternately you can simply place the patch (named exactly like the rom
except for the extension) in the same directory and load up the game.
