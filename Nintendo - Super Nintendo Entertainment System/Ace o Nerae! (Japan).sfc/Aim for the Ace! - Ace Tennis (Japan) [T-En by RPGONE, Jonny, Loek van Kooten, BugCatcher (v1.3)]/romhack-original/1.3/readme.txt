I. Story
--------
I'm Hiromi Oka, a first year student, at the prestigious Nishi High School. 
Well, there's an amazing person in our tennis club called Reika Ryuzaki, 
nicknamed Madam Butterfly, who's a top class tennis player. Of course, there 
are also some amazing players in the boy's tennis club like Tohdoh and Ozaki.  

I joined the club because I idolized Madam Butterfly, but the coach is such a
slave driver. He makes us train really hard every day. It's so awful. In the 
midst of all this, the match against Minami High has begun...

IA. About the Game
------------------
Aim for the Ace! is based on the classic 1970's manga by Sumika Yamamoto.

In this game, you play as Hiromi Oka, a student at Nishi High. She is only a 
beginner but has great aspirations to get to the top. Soon she realizes her 
natural talent and, combined with her coach's training, she's able to compete 
on the same level as her idol Madam Butterfly, and win. 

Help Oka achieve her destiny by defeating all her opponents in this exciting 
pseudo-3D tennis game that all fans of the series and tennis fans in general 
should try out!
