      Dragon Ball Z: Legend of the Saiyans English Patch v1.02
                           02/04/2016


NEW IN VERSION 1.02
__________________________________

Fixes numerous bugs introduced by a corrupt script insertion 
routine used in the previous patch.


NEW IN VERSION 1.01 - 06/03/2012
__________________________________

This release addresses a bug which would cause the game to crash at 
certain points when Yamcha used a Spirit Ball attack, as well as a 
glitch during the Piccolo fusion dialogue.


NEW IN VERSION 1.00 - 06/09/2011
__________________________________

All of the text in this game should be translated.  I consider this 
to be a complete translation, and barring any bug reports, this should 
be a final release.  The font has been completely replaced from the 
previous version.  After starting work on this in 1999, this monkey is 
finally off my back, and the game is complete.  Enjoy!

FAQ
__________________________________
Q: Other groups have indicated the French localization of this game 
was inaccurate or completely fake.  Is the dialogue accurate?

A: When I started on this translation, it was based in part on BessaB's 
incomplete patch.  The other groups were working from this same patch. 
The "fake" or "missing" text was unfinished, or filler dialogue.  BessaB 
never tried to pass that game off as complete, and it's a shame that some 
others did.  The French translation was completed in 2003.
