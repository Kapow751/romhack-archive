All these patches are applied the same way as the Lil' Manster BPS patch. They are all compatible with each other.

* Lil' Manster IPS is an alternate way of patching your game, if the tool you are using does not support BPS patches.
Only use this if you are 100% sure that you are patching the right rom, as this patch will not check if you have the correct one.

The other patches are smaller, optional changes that must be applied AFTER patching with Lil' Manster.
Your emulator may show a "checksum error" if you add more than one of these patches at a time, but this won't affect anything on your end.

---------------------------------------------------

Difficulty patches:

* 0% Growths makes all character growths and scroll growth bonuses 0. It's for challenge runs.

* Double WEXP gives you twice as much weapon and staff EXP for all characters. Pair with the secret Paragon mode for fully doubled character growth!

* Easy Sound Room changes the ranking requirement for unlocking the Sound Room.
Instead of an SSS, you'll need an E rank to unlock it. So, just complete the game once!

Interface patches:
* High Contrast HP Bars
This adaptation of Zane's HP bars changes the green-red HP bar to a green-black bar.

* Top-Wait.
In Lil' Manster, commands have been re-ordered to match with the command order of more recent FE games. For instance, the Wait command is located at the bottom, rather than near the top.
If this is not to your liking, this "Top-Wait" version keeps the original game's command order.
