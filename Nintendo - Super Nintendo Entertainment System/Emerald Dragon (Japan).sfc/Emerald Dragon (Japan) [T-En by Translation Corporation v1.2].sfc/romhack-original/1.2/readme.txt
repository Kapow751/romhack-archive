1.0	Information


1.1	****Patch Information****

	This patch when hard patched correctly will result in a VALID checksum.

	This patch was created for use on an original ROM that has:

	  * NO header
	  * CRC32: 0x9D0F5F98
	  * NSRT (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/400/) identified as
	    Emerald Dragon, Version 1.0, 0x7797 Checksum

	The 'TransPatch.exe' custom patching application can be used to ensure 
	you have the correct ROM and patch, and apply the patch to headered or 
	non-headered ROMs automatically. This is the recommended way to apply 
	the patch for novice patchers.

	The patcher should work on Win95/98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8, as well as

2.0	Project History and Words about the Team


2.1 Project History

	The Emerald Dragon project has an over 5 year long storied history. 
	When I started work on this project, it wasn't even mine. Back around 
	May of 2002, D-boy was asking for help on the hacking of Emerald Dragon, 
	specifically, the text compression. I started working on this for him 
	during some off time I had from Dual Orb 2. That was supposed to be all 
	I was going to do on the project. At the time, I had no intentions of 
	doing anything else with Emerald Dragon. For reasons I don't have record 
	of right now, at some point after that D-boy quit wanting to be involved 
	in any of the hacking work on Emerald Dragon. Maybe I took too long, 
	maybe it was his opinion of the SNES port, or just wanting to quit 
	hacking. I don't recall at this point. 

	In August 2002, Emerald Dragon was announced as an official project of 
	TransCorp. I had figured out the compression and started coding a script 
	dumper. D-boy was also at the helm as the translator for the project. I 
	believe it was D's Emerald Dragon page (which can still be viewed at 
	http://emedra.lakuuna.org/) that got me interested enough in Emerald 
	Dragon to pick it up as a project of my own. That and the fact that I 
	had already invested a good amount of time in it. Progress remained 
	steady on Emerald Dragon until February 2003. 
		
	In February 2003, D-boy quit over what I believe was a single passing 
	post on the message board to an inquiring fan where I mentioned merely 
	the possibility of shortening or changing Saoshyant's name. Without a 
	translator, progress was slow on Emerald Dragon through most of 2003. A 
	few technical difficulties came up with the text storage and trying to 
	get a full dump along with obstacles in the menu work. Emerald Dragon 
	was definitely a tough game to handle with many technical obstacles, 
	seemingly having many remnants of the 8-bit computer architecture 
	previous ports used. In many cases, it seemed artificial limits were 
	imposed that were not necessary for the SNES. 
		
	In February of 2004, some collaboration with David Shadoff whom was 
	working on the PCE-CD port, sparked some new motivation to pull the 
	project off the backburner. The PCE-CD version shared several technical 
	similarities and exchanged some control code information. 2004 saw a lot 
	of progress in Emerald Dragon hacking wise. The entire script was 
	re-dumped, a new set of hacks were put in place for the menus to overcome 
	space limitations, a 2-line item hack was completed and more. By 
	December of 2004, a patch was released translating with most all of the 
	non dialog work completed. However, there was still no translator for 
	the main script. 
		
	In 2005, a few translators attempted to pick up Emerald Dragon and 
	disappeared, quit, or didn't have time. That seems to always happen on 
	these projects. Sometime around April 2005, Eien Ni Hen signed up to 
	translate the script. She retranslated all parts that were done already 
	and got to work on the rest of the script. Thankfully, Eien proved to be
	much more reliable than past translators. 
		
	2006 was a rather dark year for Emerald Dragon as much of my time was 
	spent bringing the Wozz project to a close. Eien finished the tentative 
	final version of the script though in early 2006. Unfortunately, there 
	wasn't enough man power to work on and complete both projects at the 
	same time.  
		
	In 2007, after being burnt out from Wozz, I took a good deal of time off 
	from ROM hacking and was instead working on the ROMhacking.net site. It 
	wasn't until July 2007, the 10th anniversary of TransCorp that I really 
	got motivated again to finish Emerald Dragon up. In only a few months 
	time, I reorganized and reworked all past hacking work on the project, 
	coded an inserter for the game, inserted the entire script, and had the 
	project ready for beta by the end of October. 
		
	We've spent the rest of the time between then and now fixing the game 
	and script up to be the best we know how for a public release. It's 
	always a proud moment when a lengthy multi-year project gets finished, 
	but I am truly proud of the Emerald Dragon Project itself. I'm happy 
	with the script Eien put out in the end, and I am happy with the hacking 
	work. I didn't have to make many compromises to my own ideals on it and 
	got to do most of what I wanted to do. 

	I really hope you'll enjoy several more years worth of my passion for 
	and dedication to this hobby and community. I freely and proudly give 
	you the opportunity to play Emerald Dragon in English. Thank you to all 
	who have given me words of support, all who have given a helping hand to 
	the project, and the fans of TransCorp and our community. Take it, love 
	it, cherish it! 
	    
2.1 The Team (Aside from Nightcrawler)

	Eien Ni Hen:

	Eien proved to be a more reliable translator then any I have previously 
	worked with. Communication was good, and she worked as diligently as 
	could be expected on a hobby/volunteer based project. Those of us in our 
	adult lives can really appreciate efforts like this knowing how 
	difficult it can be. Thanks goes to Eien for being patient waiting for 
	me to finish up the hacking long after she completed the script. I hope 
	the experience was as good for her in return. 

	Beta Testers:

	After having such a successful beta testing team for Wozz, I thought I'd 
	try to reassemble most of the team and make some magic all over again. I 
	would like to thank the beta testing team of Eien Ni Hen, Princess, King 
	Mike, and Misty for finding and filing over 200 issues into the bug 
	tracker! I'd also like to thank Trunkz0r and Liana for their partial 
	testing assistance. Emerald Dragon was demanding on beta testers to find 
	instances where text did not fit in the window as every text box in the 
	game had it's own independent size stored separately from the dialog. 
	While an automated in game approach was created, it could not cover all 
	possible cases. 


3.0 	About the Game


	Emerald Dragon is a fun little refreshing game all around. On the 
	surface it looks like your average 16-bit SNES RPG, and in some respect 
	it is, but dig a little deeper and you'll discover the gold. The charm 
	in this game is the character development. The games plot is driven by 
	character development and interaction rather than the typical story 
	telling fashion of most RPGs. There are 11 characters that will come in 
	and out of your party throughout the game. Some will be more developed 
	than others, but the core party members get well developed and you 
	actually care what happens to them at the end of the game. This was a 
	big selling point for me on this game. 
		
	The main plot spins around a relationship and promise between a human 
	named Tamryn, and a dragon named Atrushan. There's also a second primary 
	relationship that develops throughout the game. I won't spoil the plot 
	much, but in addition to that, you've got the typical RPG fare of 
	fighting the Demon Army, villagers with attitudes, ancient Dragon Gods, 
	and treasures to be found. The game does not shy away from dealing with 
	death, war, oppression and some other dark issues. 
		
	The battle system blends your typical turn based RPG with Ys series like 
	ramming enemies! It's pretty simple, but adds a little bit of strategy 
	with your stamina points for each turn and items and what not. Only 
	Atrushan is actually playable. Only controlling one character in battle 
	turned out to be more fun than I thought. The computer AI was adequate 
	and I didn't find myself yelling at them out loud often! Atrushan and 
	Tamryn are the only characters that level up, and it was interesting to 
	see Tamryn progress her skills under AI control. The encounter rate is 
	somewhat high, but the battles are typically fast paced and easy enough 
	to be fun. 
		
	Emerald Dragon is an RPG that has spanned ports across several systems. 
	It has been on the PC88/98, MSX, x68000, PCE-CDROM(Turbo Duo),FM-towns, 
	and the SNES! There must have been something about this game to warrant 
	so many ports. Those of you whom have read D's Emerald Dragon page will 
	certainly have read his opinion on what he believes to be an inferior 
	port. While some points are true, there are definitely some inaccuracies 
	there (the musical changes off hand for one) as well as some arguably 
	just and unjust attacks. I have also played the FM Towns version and the 
	PCE-CD version myself and there are certainly things I prefer in the 
	SNES port and things I prefer from the others. The SNES port certainly 
	has it's pluses and minuses and contains many changes (as do the other 
	ports), but it is currently the only version with an English translation 
	at present time.  
		
	I found it to be a fun game to play and I hope you will too.

	
4.0	Credits


	Here are the people that helped make this translation possible. 
	Be thankful to all. ;)

	Hacking:        Nightcrawler
	Translators:	Eien Ni Hen
	Beta Testers:	KingMike, Misty, Princess, Eien Ni Hen
	Title Screen:	FlashPV


5.0  What you will find in this patch:


	It's complete now, so you SHOULD find everything 100% translated! 

	If you find any bugs, please report them at the TransCorp message board.

	Easter Egg:

	You will also find myself, Nightcrawler, hidden in the game somewhere. I 
	used the custom sprite seen in the upper left corner of the splash 
	screen, so you will know it when you find me. I'll be up to my usual 
	antics. :) 

	
6.0   Known Issues:


	Using the 'Remove' command from the 'Equip' menu may in some instances 
	corrupt the 'Equip' menu title when exiting. Due to the dynamic nature 
	of the game engine, I was unable to consistently reproduce the issue to 
	fix it as each time you load the menu, things are loading in different 
	RAM and VRAM locations. Honestly, I got too frustrated to fix it under 
	those conditions. It should be unnecessary to use this command anyway as 
	you don't need to manually remove equipment as equipping new equipment 
	does this automatically. Gameplay should be unaffected.
