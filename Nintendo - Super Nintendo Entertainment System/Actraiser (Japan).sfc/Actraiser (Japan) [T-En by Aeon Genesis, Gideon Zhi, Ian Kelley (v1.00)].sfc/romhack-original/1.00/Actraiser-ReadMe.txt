1.About Actraiser
-----------------
Actraiser, one of the first games ever released for the
Super NES, was coincidentally one of the most ground-
breaking games I've ever had the fortune to play. It
playfully mixes action segments with real-time simulation,
throws some RPG elements into the pot and allows it to
boil. The result is one of the most interesting and fun
games I've ever played.

In Actraiser, you play the role of a god whose world has
been ravaged by Satan. It is a barren world; life only
appears in the twisted forms of the monsters that roam
its surface. Your first task in each region is to take on
an earthly form and strike down the monsters that inhabit
it. This takes the form of a sidescrolling action sequence.
After the "Act" has been cleared, you are then tasked with
fostering the return of humankind and the growth of
civilization in the town. This takes the form of a top-
down simulation; you control an angel to fight off airborne
demons, tell the people where to build, perform miracles,
and solve the various everyday problems that the folks
come up with. It's very cleverly done - as the world's
population increases, so too does your level and strength.

2.Patch History
---------------
This project initially started as a translation of the
French version of the game, which included an "expert mode"
selectable from the main menu, along with the "normal" game.
Like the US version of Megaman 2, the so-called expert mode
was really the original Japanese difficulty, while the
normal was the easier, more comfortable version custom-made
for an American audience. This is, instead, a complete
retranslation of the original Japanese version; no such easy
mode is present. While many of the differences are cosmetic,
there are a few references (to honorable suicide and
slavery) that, I believe, were deemed offensive, and if I
recall correctly, were removed from the US version of the
game. Also, as mentioned, much of the game is harder; there
are more obstacles and enemies, and spells often take up
more than 1MP each (making the Shooting Star magic
substantially less brokenly-powerful, as it can be used much
less frequently.)

4.Known Issues
--------------
--One of the testers reported that the game hung for him on
  on the "AREA CLEAR" screen after defeating the final boss.
  I have since only been able to replicate this by enabling
  an infinite health code, so I am unsure as to whether or
  not it is really an issue.

such on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)

6.Application Instructions
--------------------------
If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "actj.smc" make sure the patch
is "actj.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 1.00 MB (1,048,576 bytes)". SNESTool will remove all
of your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://www.romhacking.net
In the Utilities section, simply search for snestool.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you
apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely does
not have a header.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you remove its header.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.
