=================================================================================
I. What's New?
=================================================================================

v 2.00 (June 20 2003) - Major Re-release. Tons of changes including but not 
limited to:
1) Equip menus redone to duplicate look of Japanese one.
2) Expanded the ministatus menu. No more squishy letters for status. And 8 letter
names now everywhere in both games (something that no other translator, not even 
Enix themselves, had ever done ^_~ ).
3) Redid the asm for everything. Better loading times on real hardware, specially
menus that have 2 line items. 
4) Fixed all remaining bugs that we are aware of, except the clone prince in DQ2 
which is partially fixed to not delete his experience, lvl, etc...
5) Added more names for prince and princess that join your party in DQ2. One to 
celebrate the new largest rpg company in the world.
6) Translated and redid the title screen for DQ1.
7) DQ2 intro and ending fixed to synchronize with the music.
8) Spacing in text, and letters resized for a better, more uniform look.
9) Dialogue formatted for a more aesthetic look.
10) Even more dialogue corrections and editing.


KNOWN ISSUES - 
1) This release is mostly incompatible with savestates and battery saves from 
version 1.0 or 1.1, as well as the Japanese saves. So please keep that in mind.

2) Apparently many people are downloading bad roms for this game, which can cause 
numerous sound and crashing problems. Make sure your rom is 1,573,376 bytes, 
nothing more, nothing less. If it's not that please download another one.

3) Sometimes if you have stereo sound enabled in ZSNES, and a frame skip or 
frame rate of 2 or higher, the game will get stuck on a note and freeze. This 
is an issue with the Japanese version also, so it's not our problem. 


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DQ AND DW VERSIONS - 
- The DQ or DW after the version number indicate the translation you're playing. 
- The DQ VERSION uses character, class, town and item names that are more 
faithful to the original Japanese version. For example, the ancestor of the main 
characters is Roto. Also certain dialogue may sound more "eastern." 
- The DW VERSION uses character, class, town and item names that are more 
"Americanized" and may resemble the names from the original Nintendo of America/
Enix of America NES translations. However, the script still remains faithful to 
the SFC Japanese script, though there are some minor differences from the DQ 
version's. 
- Most of the changes are merely cosmetic, so choose whichever one you're more 
interested in. Or play both to see the changes. ^_^


v 1.10 (July 26 2002) - Thanks to all who reported problems and send in 
savestates!

1) Certain enemy names fixed.
2) Certain item names and functions fixed.
3) Crashing for lightning sword and leaf of world tree fixed. (hopefully)
4) Major item duplication fixed: only displays one major item at a time.
5) Enemies now flash before they die.
6) Character names for DQ when trading items are now correct.
7) Fixed the cloned Prince problem.
8) Numerous other dialogue-related fixes, including inconsistent naming on the DQ 
patch.
9) Missing pointer for rescuing Princess after the defeat of Dragonlord fixed.


v 1.00 (July 13 2002) - First Public Release

II. Foreword
=================================================================================

Dragon Warrior holds a special place in my memories. I played Dragon Warrior
1 and 2 at a time in my life when I needed activities that could be done from a 
bed. I was going through many surgeries at the time. These 2 games gave me much 
enjoyment at a time when nothing else did. I could lose myself in the games, and 
not worry about the problems I was going through. Then real life took over and I 
never played another Dragon Warrior game for a while.

Two years ago, I found out that I could play the Super Famicom versions of the 
Dragon Quest games on a PC. This so elated me, that I immediately found Dragon 
Quest 1 and 2 Reprise and played it, even though I couldn't understand a word of 
Japanese. That's when I decided to check more into translating/hacking the game 
like other translation/hacking groups and individuals did to other great Super 
Famicom games. That's when I bought the cartridge from a local vendor, and my 
journey began.

I had no knowledge of assembly programming at the time, and produced my first 
patch. It was a hack of the NES text from Dragon Warrior 1. I really didn't have 
much done on it when I realized that the method I was using just wouldn't work 
well. It was not producing a level of quality that I had noticed in other groups 
projects like DeJap, J2e, and others. This is when I decided to learn assembly 
programming so that I could do things like expand menus, 8 letter names, expand 
spell  and item names, etc. I had no knowledge of how to program in anything 
except Basic. That is when I was told by several people to just give up, because 
the scripts could never be dumped properly due to the way the dialogue was 
stored, and how the pointers for the text worked. I rose to the challenge, and 
after learning what the control codes were in the text, I could easily
tell where the dialogue was in the rom. I made complete script dumps, but had no 
translator. Up to this point, several groups and individuals had tried 
translating/hacking this game. But none had ever seen it through to completion. 
I was determined to show that it could be done, and that I could learn what was 
needed to complete the project with much better quality than I had done in the 
past. I was willing to do anything it took. 

I joined up with Fear Gaia, who for personal reasons left the scene a few months 
later. I continued working on the game with my friend, Arch Demon, from a 
Portuguese translation/hacking group, and then made contact with other people 
in the scene, Dark Force, Byuu, spSpiff, and a few other poeple really helped me 
out. Byuu and I joined efforts after that. I became very ill, and "disappeared" 
for a few months. When I returned in better health with a new computer and no 
files for the project, Byuu was not hacking actively. I really wanted to finish 
the game. By some miracle, I was contacted by Gideon Zhi who had the files from 
Byuu that I needed. So I set out to complete the project with translated English 
scripts by spSpiff. After much aggravation, personal sacrifices, help from many 
different people, and lots of time and headaches, it is finally done!

The final result is this patch, which I hope is our last patch necessary for this 
game. Thanks to everyone who offered any words of encouragement, or a helping 
hand when it was needed.

P.S. Please read the rest of this file before playing the game. Enjoy!

III. How to Start Playing
=================================================================================

The zip includes this readme and the DWI.II IPS file. You will need to apply this
patch onto a ROM image of DWI&II. Please do not ask us where to obtain this 
image, it can be done with a careful search of the Internet. However, it is 
required that this patch be applied to the ORIGINAL, unmodified ROM. 

To apply the image, to will need an IPS patching program. The easiest one to use 
would be IPSWin. You can get this and other programs from www.emuxhaven.net. Open 
this IPS program and apply the patch (.IPS file)in this zip archive to the 
original Dragon Quest I.II Reprise rom. 

Note: You can also use ZSNES or Snes9x's autopatch features, which will let you 
patch the rom without using the patcher. All you have to do is rename the patch 
to the same name as your rom's filename (with the ips extension instead of the 
extension your rom uses, i.e. DQ.IPS if your romname is DQ.SFC), and place the 
file in the same folder as your battery srams (where your emulator stores your 
SRM files.)

After you patch/autopatch the ROM, just start up the emulator, load up the rom, 
and start playing!

IV. Playing the Game
=================================================================================

The Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior series of games is a role-playing experience that
many other games have tried to reproduce. Each game features a true RPG character
who Enix wants you to call your alter-ego, and allows you to name and personify
the character with your own personality. Each DQ game has a battle system that
features a first-person view of the battle, making the role-playing 
experience even more authentic. 

Like every classic RPG game, DQ I.II allows you to explore a fantasy world 
full of memorable characters and villains. You will play as one character in DQ I
and three characters in DQ II. Make them fight and cast magic and help them to 
develop into seasoned warriors of legend powerful enough to defeat evil and save 
the world.

         Does NOT allow you to save.
Item   : Use an Item, or discard an item.
Door   : Opens a door. (In DQ1, only if you have a Magic Key)

MISCELLANEOUS AND TIPS:

 - Unlike later games in the Dragon Warrior/Quest series, you MUST save by
   talking to a king (with a few exceptions). When you die you will lose a 
   portion of your gold and automatically warp back to the king you previously 
   saved at.
 - Churches in DQ1 will only heal you. Churches in DQ2 will heal your status
   ailments and revive dead characters. They do NOT allow you to save.
 - Talk to everybody and pay close attention to what they say. To finish the 
   game, you will need to go to obscure places and find hidden treasures, so talk 
   to everyone you see for hints of what you should do next.
