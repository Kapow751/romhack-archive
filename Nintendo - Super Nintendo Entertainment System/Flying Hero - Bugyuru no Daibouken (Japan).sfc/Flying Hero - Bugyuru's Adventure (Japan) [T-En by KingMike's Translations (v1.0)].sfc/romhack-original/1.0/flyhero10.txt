INTROUCTION
***********
Flying Hero is a "cute 'em up" by Sting (better known for their unusual RPGs,
this may have been their first game) and SOFEL.
A fairly uknown game, but I think it's pretty good.
Typical of cute 'em ups, it's also quite challenging. If you can finish it
without cheating (especially hard mode), you are quite skilled.
Bugyuru is some little flying egg/ball thing, Pao is his girlfriend.
For no real reason, the vampire Biblio has captured her, and Bugyuru
must rescue her. A simple story, but who really cares about plot in
a shooter?

PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS
*********************
 Either apply the IPS version of the patch to an original Japanese ROM,
 or use a program such as upset (from byuu.org) to apply the UPS version.

 And I suppose you know not to apply it to a pre-patched ROM.

 This patch is for a non-headered ROM.
 I have changed the checksum so it should be correct on a properly-patched ROM.

Screen
 At the top left, you will see your score.
 There will also be wings to indicate your flying speed. Press Select to change.
 Of course, choose a faster speed will allow you to fly faster, but with less precision.

 At the bottom left is your lives counter. I believe you can get more if you get enough points.

 At the bottom right is the number of cakes you've collected,
 and below that is your bomb supply. You get three per life.

Weapons
 Flakes : Shoots snowflakes at your enemies. Slow but strong.
 Lightning : Shoots lightning at your enemies. Your shot grows in length.
 Bulb : Normal shot.
 Cluster : Also normal shot?

 The elephant-like icon adds a hornet swarm to your shot.
  They are heat-seeking. Very useful upgrade.

 Cake: Collect three of them to upgrade your weapon one level.
  When you take a hit, your weapon will be downgraded one level.
  The hornets will be removed if you take a hit and your weapon is
   already at the lowest level.
  If you are already at the lowest possible weaponry when you
   take a hit, you will lose a life.

 Triple cake: Same as three cakes. It immediately upgrades your weapon.
  If you are already at maximum, it does nothing.

Continue
 When you have lost a life and you have no more in reserve, the game is over.
 You are allowed to continue from the beginning of the current stage.
 You have three chances to continue.
