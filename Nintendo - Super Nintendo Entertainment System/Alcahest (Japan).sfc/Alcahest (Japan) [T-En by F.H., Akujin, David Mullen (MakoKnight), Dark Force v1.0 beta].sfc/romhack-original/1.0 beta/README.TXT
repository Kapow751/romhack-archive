How To Use This Patch (IMPORTANT INFORMATION)
=============================================

The IPS file must be patched to the original ROM image in order to play
this translation. If you are using ZSNES to play this game, then you
can simply place the IPS file in the same directory as your save files,
and ZSNES will automatically read the patch and apply it, without
changing your original ROM. The IPS file must be named the same as your
ROM for this to work.

If you are using another emulator, you will have to patch the game
manually. IPS.exe and Snestool are two common programs that can do
this, and they can be found at most emulation and translation websites.
Before patching your ROM, *always* make sure you keep a backup copy.

To use IPS.exe, type this at a command prompt:

IPS <ROM name> <IPS name>

where <ROM name> is the name and location of the ROM to be patched, and
<IPS name> is the name and location of the IPS file to be used.

Snestool has a graphic interface and doesn't require command line
arguments. After loading it, select the "Use IPS" option. Then find the
IPS file in the browser window to the left and select it. After that,
select the ROM that the IPS should be applied to.

The unpatched file size should be 1049088 bytes. The patched file size 
should be 1180160 bytes.  Any variation in the patched file size would be down 
to your patching utility and not the IPS file; it would also cause 
problems with running the ROM image. PROBLEMS MAY OCCUR USING A MAC IPS
PATCHING UTIL WHICH MAKES THE ROM ONE BYTE SHORT.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS!



================
Running the Game
================

The best medium would be a real 60Hz S-NES (via back-up unit) displayed
via a RGB SCART cable.

Both snes9x Win and Zsnes Win seem to competantly handle the emulation.

******** PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT INFORMATION ***************
This patch may be freely distributed, as long as:

    There's been one case of an overwritten patch of FM where next to no

    our readme.txt).  This 'overwriting' saddens
    us to the point of doing something else more rewarding and we
    ask you to respect our wishes.

 - This readme file accompanies the patch.
    (is this too large a thing to ask for???? :(   )

 - The ROM image is not distributed with this patch already applied.

Quick Thank You's and Greetings from the available Alcahest Trans' Team

Greets from FH to.........
Alc Trans Team -  Thank you guys for working with me - this translation
                  wouldn't be here without you!

Necrosaro -       I just want to say I appreciate the initial translation
                  script you sent for this game.  Though it was never used,
                  it was work that never went unnoticed.  If only there
                  was more talented people such as yourself working in
                  translations! ^^
                  
NoComply -        For still putting up with me!! =PP  

Jason Li -        For the chats, artwork & <cough> band sessions! ;)

My Family -       For still being there.

My Work Buddies - Ditto.
