  This is an UNOFFICIAL English translation of FINAL
FANTASY V, the SQUARESOFT RPG everyone's been wanting to
play for ages now.  SQUARESOFT never released it in
English, for some reason.  A release is rumored for the PC
sometime later this year, however.

2. Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------

  The translation of FINAL FANTASY V is the result of the
combined effort of many people, and has been worked on for
a long time.  The first efforts to translate this game
date back to April 1997, by Shadow.  Many others were
involved in the project, but it basically ended up being
myself, Barubary, and SoM2Freak.  After almost 10 months
since I joined the project, and it was finally released as
a complete version.  Since then, several mistakes have
been fixed, and eventually this version is being released.

3. How to Start
----------------------------------------------------------

  The archive includes an IPS file.  The IPS file is to be
applied to ROM images acquired from somewhere else, and
it's up to you to obtain it.

  First, you need a copy of the Final Fantasy V ROM image,
and an IPS patching program.  An easy-to-use patching
program for MS-DOS based systems, IPS.EXE, can be obtained
at RPGe (http://fx.ml.org/rpge/archives/).

  This patch must be applied to the ORIGINAL, unmodified
ROM.

  To use IPS.EXE with the Final Fantasy V patch, get
yourself a DOS prompt and type the following:

  IPS FF5.SMC FF5-V110.IPS

  Replace FF5.SMC with the filename of your ROM image.

  After you've patched your ROM image, load the game
inside your favorite SNES emulator, and you should see the
title screen.  You're ready to start.
