1. Installation Information

I know that the first question on my mind when I actually go to read a readme is "How do I install it?"

The answer? Final Fantasy V: LOTC is an .ips patch that is intended for a NON-HEADER rom file. You will have to obtain a copy of the Super Famicom game cardrige and a device with which it can be read to disk (and that's all you say if asked. I trust you are familiar by now, it's 2021).

Take this copy, which will be an extension either .smc or .sfc (it doesn't matter), with the checksum of:

File SHA1    E937B54FFF99838E2E853697E4F559359AA91FD6
ROM SHA1    E937B54FFF99838E2E853697E4F559359AA91FD6
File MD5    D69B2115E17D1CF2CB3590D3F75FEBB9
ROM MD5    D69B2115E17D1CF2CB3590D3F75FEBB9
File CRC32    C1BC267D
ROM CRC32    C1BC267D

It is recommended to use Lunar Ips to apply the patch.

2. "Why male models?"

Yeah I know. There's a zillion takes on FFV already up and out there. I still just like playing it on the SNES cuz it just ruins the game feel for me to play any of the other versions. If you're like me, and just want it to move the way it did, then this might be a mod you could try out.

Firstly, and this was done with the expressed permission of harmony7, whom informed the authors that permission was given by MyriaKitty as well, to edit the script, back in 2014, the script has received a major edit. This goes over and above the previous editing attempt with WindHex, now being liberated by the versatile FF5e Text Editor by Noisecross.

Secondly, some several alternate patches have become available in the interim, and it was deemed fit to include them. None of them break the rules of the game per se; they are more stylistic touches.

Finally, many of the players of FF5 in English have been doing it since the dawn of romhacking; FF5 RPGe was used as a basis for this very project. It has been quite a ride, and I for one still kind of prefer the RPGe script to GBA, if only out of nostalgia. This patch takes that script and dresses it up like a pirate captain and gets all Yo-ho-ho and stuff... among other rewrites. None of the plot was changed.

It was created using FF5e Text Editor v1.6 and Windhex, and is based off of an edit done by Spooniest in 2014 and 15, last updated 09 February 2017.

4. Work Log

Work began on January 27, 2021 and continued through 2/27/2021.

Script was updated/reformatted/rewritten and in no more and no less than exactly 2 cases, roughly retranslated.
Location Names were updated.
Monster Names were updated.
Short/Long Item Names were updated.
Icons were added to the font: Summon Orb and Coins (for the shops)
Battle Dialogs were updated.

Modern terminology was used in any case in which there were enough spaces to do it without creating squish tiles.

On February 27th in the evening, work commenced on the Poem Of Light.
As of 9:39pm Central Standard Time, the Poem Of Light was completed. It now scrolls correctly and is centered like the Japanese Version.

5. Special Thanks

To Squaresoft, Hironobu Sakaguchi, Nobuo Uematsu, Yoshinori Kitase, Spooniest's brother who got him off his butt and into romhacking, harmony7 and MyriaKitty, without whom this would not be possible, Noisecross, without whose editor this would not have been anywhere near as good, and to Erin Ellis for the excellent GBA script, many of which's lines were used, quote "because they just sound better."
