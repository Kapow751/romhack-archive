1.Cyber Knight II ~ Ambitions of the Terran Empire
--------------------------------------------------
Cyber Knight 2 is quite easily one of the best RPGs I've hacked to date.
The difficulty progression is well-balanced, the plot is astounding, the
music is great, battles are fun as hell and awesome to watch, it innovates
in places you'd never think nothing could ever innovate in. The game is
fantastic!

It's a direct sequel to the original Cyber Knight, so prior knowledge is a
definite plus, but is not strictly necessary. The backstory, in short: in
order to save themselves from certain destruction, the mercenary crew of
the SS Swordfish performed a hyperspacial jump without inputting any
destination coordinates, and ended up in the far-reaches of uncharted space.
There they encountered lifeforms known as "Berserkers", biomechanical killing
machines intent on wiping out all life in the universe. They also
encountered a hyper-intelligent being known as Mentana, who was able to open
a hyperspace tunnel back to Earth after they defeated the Berserker Queen
and ended the threat.

If only things were so simple.

Upon their return to federated space, the Swordfish was beset upon by the
Terran government, the hyper-advanced technology ("OverTech") developed
through Berserker research seized and the crew placed in prison. They are
soon sprung by the Kazelin army, and learn that a new dictator on Earth is
planning on using the OverTech to create new weapons and take over the
galaxy...

2.Patch History
---------------
Cyber Knight 2 is the result of a tightly-coordinated effort between myself
as ASM hacker and script proofer, Deuce as translator, and z80gaiden and his
friend as compression gurus. Thanks to the incredible speed at which everyone
worked without sacrificing any quality in the final product, I am extremely,
extremely excited to announce that not only has the project taken just under
two months to reach a very nicely polished completed state, we were able to
get it ready for release on the fourth anniversary of the patch release for
the original Cyber Knight, and damn was it worth the wait!

November 17, 2005 - Initial version 1.00 Release

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
Quick ROM Info:
2.00MB (16mbit LoROM), WITHOUT Header (2,097,152 bytes).

If using ZSNES, make sure that the patch has the same name as your ROM.
In other words, if your ROM is called "cknight2.smc" make sure the patch
is "cknight2.ips" okay? If you're using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is
available. Check the AGTP Links page. If you're using a copier, you
probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure to apply the
patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES NOT HAVE
A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties, it
should read "Size: 2.00 MB (2,097,152 bytes)". SNESTool can remove
your headers for you easily, and you can find it at
http://rpgd.emulationworld.com
In the utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.

An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if you do
the above and the game does not run, it probably has a header. Use
SNESTool to remove the header from a clean Japanese ROM and try again.
And don't whine about SNESTool not working in Windows XP, it works
fine for me and I'm running on XP Pro.

-----------------
6.Troubleshooting
-----------------
--If the game does not run at all, read the above section on
  application instructions (specifically on header removal.)
  Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you add its header.
  Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and
  the game crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the
  patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.

  Also note that Cyber Knight 2 will not run on some earlier
  versions of ZSNES. It crashes in 1.337, but I know for a fact
  that it works fine in 1.40 and later. Unsure of 1.36.
