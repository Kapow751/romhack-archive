*      CHAPTER 01.0      *
*Events of Cyber Knight I*
**************************

In the year 2352, the mercenary starship Swordfish found itself under attack
by group of space pirates. Faced with no option other than certain doom, the
commander, Blade Bryant, ordered the use of the ship's Jump Drive, even
though there was not enough time to calculate destination coordinates. The
result was a phenomenon known as a "Jump Miss", and the crew ended up in the
center of the universe, far away from known space.

There they encountered a lifeform known as a Berserker, a self-aware
biomechanical war machine. These Berserkers were on the verge of wiping out
all life in that area of space, and were it not for Blade and his crew, they
would have soon spread throughout the entire universe, destroying everything
they found.

Blade and his crew were able to research the wreckage of destroyed Berserker
robots, through which they developed new weapons and improved the power of
their Battle Modules - robotic power armor used to enhance the natural
abilities of humans for construction and combat. They were eventually able
to destroy the Berserker Queen, and eliminate the threat of the Berserkers
once and for all.

They were also able to encounter an intelligence known as Mentana in the
center of a black hole, at whose request they fought the Berserker Queen,
and who was finally able send them back to Earth through a stargate. A
hyper-intelligent being, Mentana had many hundreds of years to evolve its
intelligence, and had become roughly equivalent to a god in the process.

Upon its return to known space, however, the Swordfish was not greeted
warmly. The Earth Federation immediately seized it and the technology it
was carrying. The main crew was imprisoned, and the professor comitted to
the research and development of their Modules was detained and forced to
continue. The "OverTech", far in advance of anything the galaxy had seen
before, was being used to develop new weapons under the dictatorial regime
on Earth.

As Blade and his crew escape from the Federation's detainment facility, they
hear of a new weapon being developed by Earth's scientists, which combines
the OverTech and the data on the Berserkers into something completely new and
very, very dangerous...

*********************************
*         CHAPTER  02.0         *
*The Galvodirge, Your Mothership*
*********************************

Welcome to your new home, the starship Galvordirge! It is outfitted with the
latest simulated-personality artificial intelligence construct, AIDA, which,
although inferior in some respects to the MICA computer developed by
Professor Dinett and installed onboard the Swordfish, should serve you
nicely.

The Galvodirge is equipped with all of the standard amenities you have come
to know and love, including a new state-of-the-art bridge, a medical unit
complete with clone facilities, a lounge with the latest in video
entertainment, a laboratory for research, a hangar in which to store your
Battle Modules, and a brand new combat simulator, perfect for training. It
also, of course, has an airlock, should you ever desire to leave the ship
without your Battle Modules.

***************
*CHAPTER  02.1*
* The  Bridge *
***************

You will find the computer systems on the Galvodirge's bridge to be far in
advance of those onboard the Swordfish. Your star chart, viewable from the
"Long Jump" option in your heads-up display, displays a map of the galaxy.
Of particular interest to you is that, should a star system be inhabited,
the capital planet will be displayed in green underneath your Destination
star.

To warp to a new star system, open the Long Jump option in your menu, move
the green cursor to a new star system, and press the A button. Your current
location is highlighted in flashing white, and again, if your destination
has inhabited worlds in it, the capital planet will be displayed in green.

To warp to another planet in the star system you're currently located in,
select the "Short Jump" option, then simply select a planet from the list.
Any planets that are inhabited and can be landed on, once initially scanned,
will be listed as such in the right-hand column. Any unscanned planets will
not have any information next to them in this window. A planet will be
automatically scanned when you first visit it, but you may re-scan the world
you're orbitting at any time by re-selecting it from the Short Jump menu.
Occasionally, new information about the political situation on inhabited
worlds can be gleaned from such rescanning.

***************
*CHAPTER  02.2*
*   Sickbay   *
***************

The medical facilites aboard the Galvodirge are able to treat virtually any
wound you may receive while fighting either on foot or in Modules. While a
"cure" for death has not been discovered yet, your DNA data is always kept
on record and is periodically updated so that in the eventuality that you
are killed, a new clone may be regenerated. Select "Treat" from the menu to
have the doctor cure any ills you may be experiencing.

The medical facility is also where you may take a break if you need to stop
playing the game for whatever reason. Select "Clone Clode" from the menu to
record your current data into the Galvodirge's memory banks. You may then
re-clone your progress from the main menu at the title screen.

**************
*CHAPTER 02.3*
* The Lounge *
**************

The Lounge is where your crew will relax when they're not on duty. You may
view any of their data at any time here by selecting the "Character" option
from the on-screen menu.

You may also organize an away team here. As the commander, you are obligated
to sortie with every away team, however you may select two other crew members
as combattants with you; the remaining three, should you sortie in-Module,
will act as support units in battle. More on this later.

Each character has a very specific set of skills. All skills are important,
but thankfully as the commander you're -good- at everything. You're not the
best, though, so be sure to take with you whoever you feel would most
appropriately benefit the team in the field. More on your crew members'
skills later.

***************
*CHAPTER  02.4*
* The Airlock *
***************

You may exit the Galvodirge via the Airlock whenever you're on a world with
a breathable, non-toxic atmosphere. Do note that you will be on-foot, and
will not have the benefit of the diversity in weapons, Options, and Fields
that your Modules can equip. It is sometimes necessary to explore on-foot,
however, as there are some spaces that Modules won't be able to fit into,
and the citizens of some worlds may be put off by people walking around in
bulky battle armor.

The Airlock comes standard with an arsenal of small munitions with which
you may outfit yourself and your away team. No Fields are provided, as they
are too bulky to be carried by a single human for any real length of time,
and standard-issue Grenades are the only Options you'll have. It is a
limited selection, but it should be sufficient.

**************
*CHAPTER 02.5*
*  The  Lab  *
**************

The Lab is where you will develop new weapons and improve your Modules'
capabilities. At current, however, we have been unable to locate anyone
with the sufficient mental capacity to perform such research. You will have
to locate someone on your own.

Once you have, however, you may have him or her analyze any Neoparts you've
obtained from enemy units by selecting "Analyze" from the menu. Any new
equipment they develop will automatically be added to your arsenals, and any
improvements they make on your Modules' designs will be automatically
applied. You will have to outfit your Modules with new weapons, Options, and
Fields manually, however.

**************
*CHAPTER 02.6*
* The Hangar *
**************

The Hangar is where you will perform routine Module maintenance. It is
equipped with a team of the best engineers we could gather to ensure that
your Modules will always be in tip-top shape. Should they receive any damage
in the field, simply select Repair from the menu to refit them with any spare
parts necessary.

You may also outfit your modules with a series of weapons, Options, and
Fields in the Hangar. Do be aware that due to their designs, some Modules
will not be able to carry certain weapons and Options. Keep this in mind when
outfitting your units. To alter your Modules' loadout, select "Outfit" from
the on-screen menu.

Module assignemnts can be changed around in the Hangar as well. Once you
select "Module" from the menu, you will be asked whether you want to change
the assignments for your combat party or your support party. Certain Modules
are better in certain situations, so be sure to evaluate your needs properly
when making assignments.

The Hangar is also where you'll sortie from should you need to go out in your
Modules. You may do so on any planet, so long as you've landed.

**************
*CHAPTER 02.7*
*  Training  *
**************

The Training room is equipped with the latest in virtual reality simulation
equipment. Nearly indistinguishable from the real thing, AIDA can accurately
reproduce the data from any enemies you've encountered so far on any planet
here. You can use this to better strategize and plan for future combat
situations.

Should you be unsure of how combat operations work, also, you may elect to
have the onboard coach educate you in the ways of Module combat. It's great
for the beginner, or even the professional who just wants a few primers
before heading off to battle!

***************
*CHAPTER  03.0*
* Exploration *
***************

When exploring, you can move around using the directional pad. At any time,
you may press L or R to see a display of what planet you're exploring, and
if you're in a Module and have found the Anti-Grav unit, you may press the
X button to begin floating. Hold the B button to run, and simply walk into
people you may see on the map to begin a conversation.

**********************
*    CHAPTER 03.1    *
*When You Need a Clue*
**********************

So you've managed to escape from Federation prison, you've been given the
job of helping the forces on Kazelin prevent the spread of war by preventing
the Federation from using the OverTech to take over the universe, and you
have no idea where to begin. What's a commander to do?

Visit the command center in the Kazelin base. There you'll find a number of
young folk who're constantly scouring the radio waves for any information
that might be useful to you. Keep track of what they tell you and visit them
often, as they're an invaluable asset when you have nowhere to go!

***************
*CHAPTER  03.2*
*The Camp Menu*
***************

Press the Start button while exploring to bring up the Camp menu. If you're
in an exterior zone and are exploring in Modules, all six crew members will
be available in the list - both Combat and Support units. If you're in an
interior zone or are exploring on foot, only your Combat party will appear
in the list.

The "Character" option behaves identically to the Character command in the
Galvodirge's lounge - it displays your characters' skills, experience levels,
and various proficiencies.

The "Treat" option allows you to recover a character's Life Points (LP).
When a character runs out of LP, they're dead and must be re-cloned at the
Galvodirge's medical facilities, so be sure to treat their wounds and keep
their health up! Treatment -must- be performed by a character with a Medic
proficiency of at least 8; the Commander has some Medic skill, so unless he
dies you will never be without a doctor. The higher the Medic skill of the
character performing the treatment, the more LP restored. Each time a
character performs treatment, a Cure Kit will be expended; if you run out
of Cure Kits, treatment may no longer be performed. Return to the Galvodirge
to replenish your supply of Cure Kits.

The "Repair" option performs a similar service to the Treat command - it will
replenish a Module's Energy Points (EP). If a Module runs out of EP, it is
broken and will no longer function. However, as Modules are machines, they
may be repaired even when they're completely out of EP. A proficient mechanic
is necessary to perform repairs on your Modules; again, the Commander does
have some Mecha skill, although he is not the best mechanic onboard. Again,
the higher the Mecha skill of the character performing the repairs, the
more LP is restored. Repairs require Repair Kits; as with Cure Kits, each
repair will expend one and if you run out, repairs may no longer be
performed. Return to the Galvodirge to replenish your supply of Repair Kits.
The Repair command only appears if you've sortied in Modules; it will not
be present in the menu if you're exploring on foot.

The "Carrier" option lets you display the contents of your Carrier. It will,
largely, contain two different kinds of things - items and Neoparts. Items
will be given to you by important characters in the story, and will appear
in the right-hand column. They will only be used when necessary. Neoparts
are acquired through the destruction of unknown enemy units, and they
represent technology which your crew has not yet come into contact with. They
may be taken to the Lab on the Galvodirge for research and refinement; when
properly analyzed, they produce new weapons, Options, Fields, and upgrades to
your Modules. A character with Science proficiency is required for the
recognition of Neoparts among the enemy wreckage; the higher the Science
proficiency, the more likely your characters will notice Neoparts at the
end of a battle.

"Set Up" allows you to configure your game's text speed, audio output, and
Auto Battle settings. During Auto Battle, the settings dictate whether or
not your characters will use Options and Fields, and whether or not it will
ask you to input the first turn's commands.

******************
*  CHAPTER 04.0  *
*Character Skills*
******************

Your crew members possess a number of important attributes that you will
want to keep an eye on. These can be viewed at any time by selecting
"Character" from the Camp Menu or from the Lounge menu.

**************
*CHAPTER 04.1*
*Life  Points*
**************

Life Points represent your characters' physical health. If they run out, a
character is dead, and will need to be re-cloned at the medical facilities
on the Galvodirge. They can be replenished in the field through Treatment via
the Camp Menu; this requires a character with minimum Medic skill of 8, and a
Cure Kit, to perform the treatment. If neither a character with the Medic
skill nor any Cure Kits are present, field Treatment may not be performed.
Treatment may also be obtained in the medical facilites of the Galvodirge,
free of charge.

**************
*CHAPTER 04.2*
* Experience *
**************

As your characters fight in battle, complete missions, and utilize the skills
in which they're proficient, they will acquire experience points. When they
receive enough experience (as displayed by the number "NEXT" on the Character
screen) their level will increase, and some of their skills may increase as
well. Keep in mind that a character does not necessarily have to participate
in combat to gain experience; a competent support mechanic will gain a
point of experience for every EP he repairs in the field upon returning to
the Galvodirge, and a good scientist will gain a lot of experience for every
Neopart he spots.

**************
*CHAPTER 04.3*
*   Combat   *
**************

A character's Combat skill is a numeric quantification of how well they fight
in battle. A character with high Combat will deal more damage, take less
damage, hit more often and dodge more often, and will gain more experience
for participating in an engagement. Every crew member on board the Galvodirge
has some Combat skill, however some characters are natural fighters while
others are better at other things.

***************
*CHAPTER  04.4*
*    Mecha    *
***************

A character's Mecha skill is a numeric quantification of how good a mechanic
they are. Skilled mechanics are handy for repairing damaged Modules in the
field; a higher Mecha skill means more EP restored when using a Repair Kit.
Exceptionally skilled mechanics know hardware from the inside-out, and are
great if you need to dismantle barrier generators.

***************
*CHAPTER  04.5*
*   Medical   *
***************

A character's Medical skill is a numeric quantification of how good a doctor
they are. Skilled Medics are handy for restoring cuts, bruises, and gunshot
wounds suffered in the field. The higher a character's Medical skill when
treating someone's wounds with a Cure Kit, the higher the amount of LP will
be restored.

***************
*CHAPTER  04.6*
*   Science   *
***************

A character's Science skill is a numeric quantification of how good a
scientist they are. Skilled scientists can recognize Neoparts at the end of
engagements with new enemies. The higher a character's Science skill, the
greater the chances that Neoparts will be recognized in the wreckage of
downed foes. Exceptionally skilled scientists are great at cracking computer
databases, and should be taken on missions where such encrypted data may need
to be accessed.

*******************
*  CHAPTER  05.0  *
*Module Statistics*
*******************

Your modules are all build off of a number of core statistics, all of which
you'll want to pay attention to when forming a team. When assigning modules
to your team members (via the "Module" option in the hangar), you may view
extended information about your modules by pressing the L or R button when
they're highlighted.

A module's Energy Points (EP) represents its endurance. The higher its EP,
the more damage it can take before it breaks down. EP can be restored by
a mechanic in the field so long as you have Repair Packs, even if it
reaches zero.

A module's Defense represents its resistance to damage. The higher this
value, the fewer points of EP damage it will take when it gets hit.

A module's Evade represents its quickness on the field of combat. The higher
this value, the more likely it is to dodge attacks aimed at it.

A module's Move represents its rate of travel across the battlefield. A
module with a 2 Move, for example, will be able to traverse two grid squares
per turn.

A module's Melee represents its capacity to deal damage at close-range. The
higher this number, the more damage punches, swords, and the like will do.

A module's Pocket Size represents the number of weapons it can carry. A
weapon's size is not taken into consideration at all here; a Pocket Size
of 4 will be able to hold four weapons regardless of whether they are
one-handed or two-handed.

A module's Option Max represents the number of Options that can be equipped
on it at any given time. Should you so choose, you may equip a module with
as many of the same Option as it has available slots, or you may choose to
assign a different Option to each slot.

A module's Field Max represents the number of Fields that can be equipped
on it at any given time. Should you so choose, you may equip a module with
as many of the same Fields as it has available slots, or you may choose to
assign a different Field to each slot.

*******************
*  CHAPTER  06.0  *
*All About Modules*
*******************

Modules are suits of powered battle armor in which you will more than likely
spend most of your time fighting. They can be equipped with a vast array of
armaments, Options, and defensive Fields, and vary greatly in their core
statistics. Press L or R when assigning modules to characters to view their
core statistics, and be sure to make an informed choice about which modules
you want to bring along on a mission!

There are two types of Battle Modules in Cyber Knight 2 - Combat Modules and
Support Modules.

****************
* CHAPTER 06.1 *
*Combat Modules*
****************

Your Combat Modules will see the brunt of the action in any given mission.
They are your front line and, when an engagement occurs, most always end
up fighting. As such, they are substantially more customizable than Support
Modules, and are able to equip a wide variety of weapons and Fields to ensure
their survival on the field of battle. Combat Modules were the only type of
battle unit available in the original Cyber Knight, and they make a
triumphant return in Cyber Knight 2.

*****************
* CHAPTER  06.2 *
*Support Modules*
*****************

New to Cyber Knight 2 are Support Modules. They are assigned to whichever
three crewmembers aren't participating in a central combat role, and are
accessible during exterior combat situations (i.e. when you're not fighting
within a base, dome, or tunnel system, for example.) Often, when a battle
begins, one or more of your support units will announce that they are
commencing cover fire, and will frequently deal a large amount of damage
to the opposing force before your Combat Modules even get a chance to
fight. Occasionally, you will encounter an airborne enemy unit which only
Support Modules with surface-to-air capabilities will be able to hit, as
well.

Support characters' skills are accessible both during battle and during
camp situations. If your science officer is pilotting a Support Module and
you encounter a new enemy, he will likely notice Neoparts in the wreckage
and will gain experience for using his skill upon return to the Galvodirge.
Similarly, support mechanics can perform repairs to damaged Modules during
exterior camp situations.

*****************************
*       CHAPTER  06.3       *
*How to Improve your Modules*
*****************************

Unlike human characters, your Modules' statistics do not improve through
combat use and the accrual of experience. The only way to beef up their
strengths are to use an officer's Science skill to automatically locate
Neoparts in the wreckage of unknown enemy units at the end of combat
operations, and then take those Neoparts for analysis back in the Lab on
the Galvodirge. This will often result in the improvement of one of your
Modules' core statistics, the development of a new weapon/Option/Field,
or the improvement of the power or accuracy of a weapon type.

****************************
*       CHAPTER 07.0       *
*Outfitting Your Characters*
****************************

As your crew will inevitably experience combat situations, it is imperative
that they are properly prepared for the eventuality of battle. They should
be given a wide variety of weapons, Options, and Fields to give them an edge
in any potential fight. What follows is a brief description of each type of
equipment.

***************
*CHAPTER  07.1*
*   Weapons   *
***************

Weapons are your main means of attacking. Their ammo is infinite, their range
is varied, and any crewman can carry a number of them. Their attack will
fall into one of a few categories: Impact damage, Laser damage, Plasma
damage, Heat damage, or Special damage. Some enemies are equipped with
resistances to some forms of attack, and environmental conditions can have
an impact on some types of weapons' damage output or accuracy, so it makes
sense to carry a number of different types of weapons.

Some weapons are held in one hand; in these cases, two weapons can be
equipped. Others require both hands to weild.

A unit may carry as many weapons as his or her Pocket Size allows, one
weapon per pocket slot regardless of size or how many hands it requires to
hold. You may change a unit's weapon loadout in the hanger or in the
airlock by selecting "Outfit" from the menu, and you may view information
on a weapon by pressing either the L or R button during selection.

***************
*CHAPTER  07.2*
*   Options   *
***************

Options are limited-use, high-powered weapons that are equipped separately
from normal weapons. Each Option can be fired a limited number of times
before it must be reloaded on board the Galvodirge, but you may equip the
same Option on a unit more than once if you like, granting extra uses of
that Option.

Options again fall under one of the five core damage types listed above,
and are just as affected by enemy resistances and environmental factors as
normal weapons. Please take this into consideration while choosing your
Options for a mission. Again, while Outfitting a unit with Options, you
may press L or R in the menu to bring up a detailed analysis of the
Option in question.

**************
*CHAPTER 07.3*
*   Fields   *
**************

Fields can be seen as defensive insurance. When a Field takes effect in
battle, it will either greatly reduce the damage of an incoming attack
of a specific type, or it will greatly reduce the accuracy of an incoming
attack of a specific type. Fields are loaded onto Modules in the same
way Weapons and Armor are, and again, detailed information about any given
Field may be viewed by pressing the L or R button during selection. Simply
carrying a Field does not do anything for your Module's defenses, however;
it must be activated in battle before it can take effect. Once a Field is
activated, it lasts for the remainder of the battle, but it cannot be used
again until you return to the Galvodirge. In other words, each Field is
one-use, although you may outfit a unit with more than one of the same
Field.

**************
*CHAPTER 08.0*
*   Combat   *
**************

As much of your mission time will be spent in combat situations, it is
imperative that you are familiar with how the battle interface works. If
you ever have any questions or find this explanation to be lacking in any
way, feel free to consult the training simulation in the Galvodirge's
training bay.

********************
*   CHAPTER 08.1   *
*The Flow of Battle*
********************

If you are fighting outside, then the very first thing that might happen in
any battle situation is that one of your crewmembers will radio in with the
message, "Covering the commander!" and your support units will fire off a
volley at the enemy force. This will often thin their numbers, sometimes
completely annihilating them before your main combat party even sees any
action. Occasionally, you will encounter an airborne enemy that only your
support units can reach; if they fail to destroy it, it will fire a volley
at your combat party and depart.

Once battle is joined between two combat parties, you are given the option
to engage the enemy or escape from the battle situation. If you are not
fighting a major enemy, you will also often have an Auto Engage function,
which if your units were properly outfitted before deployment can either
save you a lot of time or cause you a lot of damage. After a turn has passed
you will also have the option to scan the enemy force, which will display
past damage values and the attacks that they correspond to.

After selecting Engage, you will give orders to your units, beginning with
movement. When the targetting reticule cursor appears, you may move it
anywhere within the lit area of the map, pressing the A button to confirm.
This represents the unit's target location for movement; once setup is
complete and the turn proceeds, it will move as close to that location as
possible. It is not always possible for it to reach the location, as the
battlefield is constantly being updated by unit movement, but it will try
its best to get there.

Once a destination has been selected, a menu of actions for the unit to take
will appear. Select "Attack" to strike an enemy with your equipped weapon,
"Defend" to improve your defense and block an attack, "Option" to fire an
Option at an enemy, or "Outfit" to change your equipped weapons or deploy a
Field. Changing weapons is instantaneous and can be done as many times
prior to issuing a final command as you like, but deploying a field takes a
full turn. IMPORTANT! If you select a melee weapon and target a far-away
enemy (or if the enemy moves out of your range), you will receive a "Cannot
attack" message. Similarly, if you elect to attack an enemy with a long-range
weapon and they move within its radius of fire, you will also receive a
"Cannot attack" message! As such, be sure to plan your turns carefully!

Once orders have been issued to all combat units, the turn will proceed. All
units will attempt to move to their designated target spots; following this,
attack orders will be processed. If there are surviving units on both sides
after all orders has been executed, combat returns to the initial Engagement
menu and the sequence repeats. Battle ends when all units on one side have
either been destroyed or have egressed from the battlefield.

******************
*  CHAPTER 08.2  *
*Finding Neoparts*
******************

Neoparts are the foundation of your Modules' improvement. With proper
analysis, they yield new weapons, Options, Fields, and various improvements
to your power output and damage dealing capabilities. Neoparts research is
essential to the continued functionality and inobsolescence of your battle

"Neoparts" are defined as new technology in an unrecognized enemy. This means
that they can be anything from a new weapon the enemy was carrying, a fluid
that makes up either circulatory system, a compound that makes up their
armor plating, or a new Field they may be carrying. By themselves these
objects are useless, but with proper analysis they may be harnessed for
on-board module use.

A competence in Science is necessary for the recognition of Neoparts. The
Commander has some Science skill, so you will always be able to recognize
Neoparts to some extent, but not to as great an extent as if you were to
bring a dedicated Science officer along on a mission. If Neoparts are found,
a message will be displayed and they will be moved into your Carrier. The
higher your character's Science skill, the more likely it is that you will
find Neoparts.

--Don't be afraid to use your Options and Fields if you think it necessary,
  but don't be frivolous with them either!
--A good field could mean the difference between an easy win and a total
  massacre!
--Keep in mind your modules' strengths and weaknesses when forming a party!
--Some enemies only have close-range attacks. Learn which they are and
  keep your distance!
--Similarly, some enemies only have ranged attacks. Get in close!

Important stuff I haven't mentioned yet
***************************************

*You can press L or R on top of any weapon, Option, Field, or Module in
the Airlock or Hangar to view data about it. Use this to your advantage
to see what's best for each situation!

*Fields last for the duration of combat (or until another Field is
activated) once used! I didn't realize this at first, and it caused me
no end of trouble. Proper use of Fields can make your life much, much
easier against some bosses!
